# 02_Diamond_Shape
This programs displays a diamond shape as an output. Its a very simple but logically important program, written in C-LANUAGE, uses nested loops.
## How is it made? 

***I have uploaded a file that shows how the shape actually looks so just make sure to give it a look before you read this!***

Well, its not exactly a diamond shape but something like that, its actually made of two triangles, one triangle placed on another upside-down triangle.
Each row of the diamond has odd no of symbols in this case it is ***asterik***.
Each row has spaces with the following formula (total no of rows - the no of row ) e.g In row no 2 of the diamond shape there will be 3 spaces considering the total no of rows are 5 i.e ( 5 - 2 = 3 ).
Also, to print the odd no of symbols(asterik) we should know that that if we multiply any number with a even numbers the answer is an even number and to make the answer an odd number we either subtract 1 from it or we add 1 to it but in this case we will subtract 1 because we want only one symbol printed in the first row of the shape.
